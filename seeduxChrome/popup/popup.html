 This page is shown when the extension button is clicked, because the
 "browser_action" field in manifest.json contains the "default_popup" key with
 value "popup.html". It exists exclusively to run popup.js, which launches a new tab where the
action actually takes place.  This tab runs a react app with entry point located in src/index.jsx -->
